The default (javac) should work as long as you have it\n      # in your system PATH.\n      'javaExecutablePath': \"javac\"\n      # Extra classpath.  This will be appended to the classpath when executing javac.\n      'classpath': ''\n\n## Classpath\n\nIt is strongly recommended that you configure your classpath via a `.classpath`\nfile within your project (typically at the root).  Simply create a file\nnamed `.classpath` somewhere within your project (ideally at the root of\nthe project).  The linter will search\nfor this file by starting at the directory of the file being compiled and then\nsearching all parent directories within the project.  If you have more than one\nof these configuration files, it will use the one that is \"closest\" to the file\nbeing compiled.  Within `.classpath` place only the classpath to be used for the\nproject (nothing else).  For example:\n\n    .:./lib/junit.jar\n\nThis linter will execute `javac` within the directory of the `.classpath`\nfile, so relative paths can be considered to be relative to that file.\n\n## Other available linters\nThere are other linters available - take a look at the linters [mainpage](https://github.com/AtomLinter/Linter).\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-javac/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-javac","_id":"linter-javac@1.1.0","_shasum":"3772156cd8f8c6ab944098f9af13413fb1f93b65","_resolved":"file:../d-115712-45953-1dfoy7h/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115712-45953-1dfoy7h/package.tgz"}
